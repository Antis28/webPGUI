##### WebP encoding tool GUI

WebP encoding tool GUI is a simple Windows application created with the objective of assisting in the conversion of images to the [WebP format] (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) (this format created by Google, allows a much higher compression then JPEG format).
Because the tool provided by Google is hard to use (command-line only with numerous tuning options via [parameters] (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) ), I decided to create this interface personal use.

**NOTE:** This application is at an early stage of development and still contains **many errors/many features are not yet available**. If there is a large public interest, I can improve the application. This is my first C# application so use the application at your risk and **be friendly with your criticism** :+1:

## Installation
##### Download the installer from: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18494731/webpgui-setup-0.1.0.exe (0.8 MB)

...or Compile the source code with Visual Studio 2015 and run the utility.

#### System Requirements
* 1 GHz CPU
* 512 MB RAM 
* Windows® XP SP3 or above (32 or 64 bits) (tested on Windows® 10) 
* .NET Framework 4
* 2 MB de free space (1.5 GB for the .NET Framework) 


## Usage
1. Install the application (if you don't have the .NET 4.0 framework installed, an internet connection is required to download the installer)
2. Choose a valid input image
3. Check the options (position the mouse pointer hover the options to check the tooltips included and learn more about the parameters)
3. Click ENCODE and see the output results

## Contributing
There is a lot to work to be done in the application, so if you are interested contact me. I will only continue the development of this application if there was a notorious interest on that.
